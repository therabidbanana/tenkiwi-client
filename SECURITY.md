## Reporting a Bug

This is a hobby project but we still know how important it is to take 
security seriously. Thank you for helping improve the security of Tenkiwi. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every 
effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs directly on Github.

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety
of the report is contained within the report and not solely behind a web
link or an attachment.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your report within 72 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, they will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the
[Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).

## Disclosure Policy

This is currently a hobby project with a single maintainer, as such, it might take a while
to fully resolve the reported issues. The maintainer will coordinate 
the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all platforms. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible wiithin the app stores. 

## Comments on this Policy
